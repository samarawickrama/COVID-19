# A Framework for Rapid Prototyping Data-Science Modelling of COVID-19 Data with Countries' Statistics - Democratizing COVID-19 Related Data Science and Analytics

## Introduction

COVID-19 became a global pandemic which has impacted human life in every aspect. Because the infection is fast spreading and endangering the human life, immediate actions need to be taken to prevent the disease in community level. By now every country has faced COVID-19 pandemic and their statistics show greater diversities. It is not quite obvious what the qualities, factors and strategies should be to focus on short-term and long-term, to   effectively face COVID-19 and similar pandemics [1, 2].

Since this is a multidimensional challenge going beyond simple imagination, data science is an effective strategy to understand the  patterns and trends in the data related to COVID-19. While data science is an effective technique to uncover insights, wide community and professionals currently rely on open visualization frameworks which mostly cover descriptive analysis techniques. If an user-friendly open data-science framework is available, subject matter experts (SMEs) can effectively adopt and effectively interpret the insights to social and human benefits [3]. 

This is a framework for rapid prototyping data-Science modelling of COVID-19 data with countries' statistics. This will help to link big datasets with COVID-19 data followed by applying advanced modelling techniques  based on machine learning. This contributes to democratizing COVID-19 related data science and analytics and promote data driven decision making and innovations.
