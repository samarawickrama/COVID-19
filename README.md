# A Framework for Rapid Prototyping Data-Science Modelling of COVID-19 Data with Countries' Statistics - Democratizing COVID-19 Related Data Science and Analytics

## Introduction

COVID-19 became a global pandemic which has impacted human life in every aspect. Because the infection is fast spreading and endangering the human life, immediate actions need to be taken to prevent the disease in community level. By now every country has faced COVID-19 pandemic and their statistics show greater diversities. It is not quite obvious what the qualities, factors and strategies should be to focus on short-term and long-term, to   effectively face COVID-19 and similar pandemics [1, 2].

Since this is a multidimensional challenge going beyond simple imagination, data science is an effective strategy to understand the  patterns and trends in the data related to COVID-19. While data science is an effective technique to uncover insights, wide community and professionals currently rely on open visualization frameworks which mostly cover descriptive analysis techniques. If an user-friendly open data-science framework is available, subject matter experts (SMEs) can effectively adopt and effectively interpret the insights to social and human benefits [3]. 

This is a framework for rapid prototyping data-Science modelling of COVID-19 data with countries' statistics. This will help to link big datasets with COVID-19 data followed by applying advanced modelling techniques  based on machine learning. This contributes to democratizing COVID-19 related data science and analytics and promote data driven decision making and innovations.

## Adopt the Framework

This framework is developed using Jupyter notebook and Python libraries. Users can install Jupyter notebook easily by installing Anaconda. Any platform which supports Jupyter notebook can be used (e.g., AWS Sagemaker). The Jupyter notebook project is available in Github.

## Datasets
To demonstrate the framework, two widely used datasets were used. They are: 

1) Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Worldometers.info open data for COVID-19 statistics of countries
2) World Bank open data for countries data and statistics

The data is available as Python libraries. Users can access this data by importing the libraries. The libraries have appropriate APIs to access the data.

Following are important references to the used libraries.

However, users do not want to limit to above data or libraries as many data sources are available to easily integrate with this framework.
